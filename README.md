## Quick Start

### Creating a Workbook

```javascript
import { Workbook } from "@cj-tech-master/excelts";

const workbook = new Workbook();
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet("My Sheet");

// Add data
sheet.addRow(["Name", "Age", "Email"]);
sheet.addRow(["John Doe", 30, "john@example.com"]);
sheet.addRow(["Jane Smith", 25, "jane@example.com"]);

// Save to file
await workbook.xlsx.writeFile("output.xlsx");
````

### Reading a Workbook

```javascript
import { Workbook } from "@cj-tech-master/excelts";

const workbook = new Workbook();
await workbook.xlsx.readFile("input.xlsx");

const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet(1);
worksheet.eachRow((row, rowNumber) => {
  console.log("Row " + rowNumber + " = " + JSON.stringify(row.values));
});
```

### Styling Cells

```javascript
// Set cell value and style
const cell = worksheet.getCell("A1");
cell.value = "Hello";
cell.font = {
  name: "Arial",
  size: 16,
  bold: true,
  color: { argb: "FFFF0000" }
